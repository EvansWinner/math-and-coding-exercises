Mostly coding exercises and puzzles which I take out of context 
(that is, I don't necessarily solve them in the language the 
person who posed the problem says to use and sometimes I cheat
by using a language where the solution is trivial). This is mainly
an excuse to learn new and interesting languages, learn some
mathematics, have fun, and play around with things.
