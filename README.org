This is a record of my progress toward my goal of teaching myself the
rudiments of mathematics, algorithmics and something of computer
programming.  Having completed only the first year or so of
high-school Algebra and two college courses in basic symbolic logic, I
intend to learn a) basic “pre-calculus” and trigonometry, the
equivalent of a first-year college course in the integral and
differential calculous, the basics of symbolic and mathematical logic,
the basics of discrete mathematics (graphs, matrix algebra,
categories) and the basics of algorithmics, data structures and
programming language semantics (type theory, et cetera).

 - There is not much organization here;
 - there are some things that were done quickly without any notion of
   being systematic, so there are some more or less random bits here
   and there.
 - there is not much here -- I’ve really only just begun and may or
   may not make much progress.
